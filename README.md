# HotwireTurboDemo

A working implementation of a Turbo iOS Application with a Rails Backend and Native iOS Login Flow

TODO:
- [ ] Document the apps correctly
- [ ] Native Signup Flow
- [ ] Push Notifications
- [ ] Add Biometric Login
- [ ] Add Native Android

I'm not an iOS developer so I took a lot of learnings from:
- [Hybrid iOS apps with Turbo by Joe Masilotti](https://masilotti.com/turbo-ios/)
- [Stewart Lynch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrTChgzseVk)
- [Drifting Ruby](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/turbo-native-for-ios)
- [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)

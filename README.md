# HotwireTurboDemo

A working implementation of a Turbo iOS Application with a Rails Backend and Native iOS Login Flow

#### TODO:
- [ ] Document the apps correctly
- [ ] Native Signup Flow
- [ ] Push Notifications
- [ ] Add Biometric Login
- [ ] Add Native Android



_Disclaimer: I'm not an iOS developer so I can't speak to the accuracy or the quality of the code but it works...hopefully ðŸ˜¬_

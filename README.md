# HotwireTurboDemo

A working implementation of a Turbo iOS Application with a Rails Backend and Native iOS Login Flow

I'm not an iOS developer so I took a lot of learnings from:
- [https://masilotti.com/turbo-ios/](Hybrid iOS apps with Turbo by Joe Masilotti)
- [https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/turbo-native-for-ios](Drifting Ruby)
- [https://www.hackingwithswift.com](Hacking With Swift)
